# golang-commons-lang

The purpose of this library is to provide functionality similar to Apache Commons Lang within the Go ecosystem.  I do not expect this library will actually be used by anyone, but
it gave me a good opportunity to play with Go so that I would learn more about the language while also reinforcing the knowledge I have already acquired.
